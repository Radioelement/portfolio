    <h2>My Journal | 22.09.2025</h2>
    <p>Greetings, I'm Bedirhan. I'm a game creator, a tech enthusiast and a highschool student. While I was going to primary school's 2nd grade, my school launched a basic coding courses school wide such as scratch acknowledge. At the same time, I was already loving my tablet that my dad bought me in these years so I decided to join it with curiosity. When I had the classes, I was fascinated with it's beuty and I was loving the program. After finishing the primary school (at middle school, 1st year) my parents told me there's a teacher giving paid courses too and my parents asked that do I want to join it. I acceptedp it and started to take the lessons. First year, had some advanced scratch classes and of course I forgot all of them. Then, we switched to mblock in second year. I was loving this program too. My dad did buy me a laptop which was cheap but enough to let me play some games and develop in mblock. I learned so much block coding in that year. I even made mini clicker game. Third year, things got more advanced. My teacher started to teach us arduino and mbot controls, coding. We even went to ODTÃœ (An university in Turkey) to join a competition. But our robot failed for some reason so we just looked around and came back after taking some photos. I had so many memories in these 3 years. I was trying to enter roblox development meanwhile, but not seriously. Just some random work with free models. In the fourth year, our teacher moved away from my town so our courses stopped at the time that we were about to start Arduino IDE learning. We got some arduino programming classes too, I even bought a beginner kit for it. Well, I prepared for highschool exam in my fourth year of middle school education. I was doing good in trial exams. But I failed to get some good score in the actual exam so I went down from good to average in that exam. I was kinda sad because of how I missed the better schools. But I didn't give up and entered a technical highschool in my town. I studied roblox studio in the summer, learned so much things which was enough to make me started working on my first game. And in my first year of highschool, I decided to start working on my "Nuclear Darkness" game project. Everything was going smoothly. Classes and exams were easy because I was in an average school with IT classes. In the first year's end, I was in really good condition. Teachers was really talktive and friendly, my friends were not bad (way more better than my middle school years) and IT classes were the things I needed. In summer, I went to a computer repairmen's shop as an apprentice. I learned how to format/clean a PC, basic shop chores and how to replace a Monitor/Laptop screen there. Meanwhile, I was still working on roblox development. In my second year of highschool, I got some interest into Visual Studio and unity. So I started learning them because of my school classes. I learnt beginner level development in Visual Studio - Windows Forms App and unity in that year.</p>
    <p class="status">Summary: I know beginner level development in Visual Studio Code, Unity, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Also, I have intermediate level acknowledge in roblox studio (Scripting, UI Design, Animating)</p>
    <h2>Contacts</h2>
    <p>To be honest, I don't usually check my gmail (Late response) so it's best for you to send me a friend request on discord and talk with me at there.</p>
    <p>Lastly, it doesn't matter who you are. If you want to talk to me just for chatting, don't be aware of talking to me through discord. I will answer if I can (if I'm not busy or unavailable).</p>
    <p>Well, thanks for visiting my website ðŸ™‚ <b>Have a great life, you deserve it !</b></p>
